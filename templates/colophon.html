    <p>This site is built with the <em>amazing</em> Python framework <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask" target="_blank">Flask</a> and with the awesome templating engine <a href="https://github.com/pallets/jinja" target="_blank">Jinja</a>. The web app is hosted with a WSGI server over at <a href="https://eu.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">PythonAnywhere</a>.<br>
    I know that I could just probably really easily use an <abbr title="static site generator">SSG</abbr>, but I just want to be able to do ridiculous things :D. So all of the pages are simply self-written HTML, which kinda works.</p>
    
    <p>All the source code of this site (including my blog, ProLi (my custom to-do list), GradeCheck and just some random APIs) is available on <a href="https://github.com/Gijs6/gijs6.nl" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. All the source code and all original other content is available in the public domain, because I don't want to restrict how others can use my code, and I really don't want to deal with the mess that is copyright law.</p>

    <p>This site uses a really simple custom theme. The main design of this site was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console" target="_blank">this Jekyll theme</a>, and several page layouts were inspired by <a href="https://geheimesite.nl/">this site (by my friend Robin)</a>.</p>
