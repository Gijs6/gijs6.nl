# Modern art is dead ...

... and it has been since the 1970s. When I say "dead", I simply mean that modern art isn't being made anymore (but "modern art isn't being made anymore" is a worse title).  
**Modern art isn't art that is made recently.** Modern art is a collection of different art movements between the 1860s and the 1970s.  
But what about art that *is* made recently? Well, that is **contemporary** art, not modern art.  
And this difference between contemporary and modern is not only made in art, it is also made in philosophy, design, architecture, music, etc.  
You can't really blame people for confusing this though, but now that you know the difference, you will see people get this wrong *all the time*.
