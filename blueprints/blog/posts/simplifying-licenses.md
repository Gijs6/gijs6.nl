# Simplifying licenses

Releasing your software into the public domain should be a simple and straightforward process. After all, by doing so, you're essentially giving up your copyright.  
Personally, I prefer the **Unlicense**, and I use it for most of my projects. However, there's something fundamentally wrong about the way public domain licenses are structured. They're often way too long, tedious, and unnecessarily complicated.

Let's take a look at the Unlicense as an example:

> This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
>
> Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or
> distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled
> binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any
> means.
>
> In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors
> of this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the
> software to the public domain. We make this dedication for the benefit
> of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and
> successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act of
> relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to this
> software under copyright law.
>
> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
> EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
> MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
> IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
> OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
> ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
> OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
>
> For more information, please refer to <https://unlicense.org/>

Why does it take nearly 200 words just to state that you don't want to enforce any copyright? The **CC0** license is even longer: over a thousand words.

If you're releasing your work into the public domain, there are effectively no restrictions on its use. So why have a lengthy license at all, when its sole purpose is to declare that there are no restrictions?

I understand that the modern copyright landscape is more than complicated, but there's definitely room for improvement here.

## The solution

The solution to this problem is quite simple. Just state that your work is in the public domain, and maybe include a brief explanation of what that means, because "the public domain" can be a bit of an abstract concept.

From now on, I'll be using this 15-word message as the "license" for all my projects:

```text
This work is hereby released into the public domain, with no restrictions on its use.
```

But isn't really a "license". Releasing your work into the public domain should be done with just a short statement, not a mess of legalese that complicates something that effectivly is just giving your software away. It's frustrating how something so straightforward has been turned into a big mess, when it really doesn't need to be.
