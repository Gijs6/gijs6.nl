# The Dutch Government is ruining its election system

The Dutch minister of the interior and kingdom relations Judith Uitermark (NSC) recently announced her plan to transform the Dutch election system by introducing a new system where 125 of the 150 members of the Second Chamber (the most important parliament in the Netherlands) would be elected via regional elections.%ref%*Minister wil verkiezingen drastisch veranderen: Tweede Kamerleden per provincie gekozen* - **RTL Nieuws**-#-https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/politiek/artikel/5501188/minister-wil-verkiezingen-drastisch-veranderen-kamerleden-provincie%ref% Her justification? It's to "strengthen the regional bond between voters and elected officials." What a load of nonsense. Let's be clear: this is a step in the wrong direction, and it's a move that will ultimately weaken the very democracy in the Netherlands.

Let's break this down. The election for the Second Chamber is supposed to be a **national** election, not a regional one. We already have regional elections: the Provincial Council elections (*Provinciale Statenverkiezingen*). So, if there's an issue with regional representation, why on earth would you mess with the national system? If regional representation is flawed, FIX THE REGIONAL SYSTEM, don't mess with the national one. Once again, **the Elections for the Second Chamber are national elections**, so everyone in the entire country should be able to vote for the same people, otherwise, it's just a bunch of completely separate regional elections which happen to be added up for one parliament. How can you justify a **NATIONAL** election where your ballot differs depending on where you live?

But that's just the start of the problems. Smaller parties will have their votes scattered across multiple districts, making it much harder for them to secure any seats at all. These parties, which rely on proportional representation, will see their votes effectively wasted.%ref%*NSC's electoral reform plan may have unwanted consequences* - **University of Groningen**-#-https://www.rug.nl/fse/news/digital-society/20250401-electoralplansnsc%ref% What's the point of voting if your vote doesn't even count? This is the kind of thing we see in places like the United States, where if you don't vote for one of the two main parties, you might as well not vote at all. That is not democracy.

Think about it: systems where votes are effectively lost, like in the U.S., or where a party can get the minority of the votes, but the majority of seats in Parliament, like in the UK, are systems that are can generate simply **undemocratic** outcomes. And now, the Dutch government is trying to take us down that very same path.

It's time to stop this before it's too late. I truly hope the Second Chamber, or the First Chamber, or hell, even the *Raad van State* steps in to block this plan. At this point, I don't care where it comes from, just stop it. We cannot allow the Dutch election system to be ruined like this. We cannot allow the Dutch government to just abolish this core democratic principle.
