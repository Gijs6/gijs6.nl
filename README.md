# [Gijs6.nl](https://www.gijs6.nl)

My own site. Built with [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and [Jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja).

This repo also includes ProLi (my own to-do/idea list), GradeCheck (a site to check what grade you have when you have a new one) and my blog. All those diffrent parts are modules (Flask blueprints are amazing) that you can find in the blueprints dir.

Have fun looking around :D

## Run yourself

If you want to run the site yourself, just clone this repo, install all the required packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `py main.py` (`flask --app main run` also works, but that could be with some diffrent settings). You can then visit the site at `localhost:7000` (or another link, the correct link will be printed in the terminal).
