        <h2>What I work with</h2>
        <p>I mostly write Python, using Flask and Jinja2. I've built a couple of static site generators from scratch, and I make CLI tools when I need to automate stuff. This is what I use for most personal projects.</p>
        <p>At work I use Elixir with Phoenix LiveView and functional programming patterns. Still learning this one, but it's pretty cool.</p>
        <p>For web stuff, I write semantic HTML, modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, light-dark mode), and JavaScript when I actually need it. I care about accessibility and keeping things simple.</p>
        <p>I'm comfortable with Git, the GNU/Linux command line, Docker, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and nginx. I can also do basic graphic design in Figma and Lunacy.</p>

                I'm doing VWO with the NT/NG profile (science & health) and NLT. I'm also on the school council (<em lang="nl">medezeggenschapsraad</em>). I finished my English exams a year early.

            <p>Haven't decided what to study at university yet. Probably something with computer science or natural sciences or maybe something completely different. I'll figure it out :)</p>

        <h2>Some projects</h2>
        <p>
            <strong><a href="https://github.com/Gijs6/gijs6.nl">This website</a>:</strong> I built a custom Python static site generator for this. No frameworks, no tracking, just static HTML. You can read <a href="/colophon">the colophon</a> for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><a href="https://github.com/Gijs6/meliag">Meliag</a>:</strong> This is a train info webapp for Dutch stations. I built it because the official NS app is way too bloated and I just want to know when my train is coming.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's more stuff I've built on the <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.
